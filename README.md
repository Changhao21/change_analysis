# This is a summary of all my work

If you find my work is helpful, welcome to cite it.

I greatly appreciate the contribution of related work mentioned below !

## 1、Binary Change Detection

The datasets we adopted is from DDPM-CD: [wgcban/ddpm-cd: Remote Sensing Change Detection using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (github.com)](https://github.com/wgcban/ddpm-cd)

The training code we adopted is from ChangeFormer: [wgcban/ChangeFormer: [IGARSS'22\]: A Transformer-Based Siamese Network for Change Detection (github.com)](https://github.com/wgcban/ChangeFormer)

- MDIPNet.py is the implementation of this work: Remote Sensing Change Detection With Bitemporal and Differential Feature Interactive Perception (TIP-2024)

## 2、Semantic Change Detection

The dataset was processed by ourselves, see our paper for details.

The training code we adopted is from Bi-SRNet: [ggsDing/Bi-SRNet (github.com)](https://github.com/ggsDing/Bi-SRNet)

- JFRNet.py is the implementation of this work: A Triple-Branch Hybrid Attention Network With Bitemporal Feature Joint Refinement for Remote-Sensing Image Semantic Change Detection (TGRS-2024)
